    "### **What is LangChain?**\n",
    "> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**~~TL~~DR**: LangChain makes the complicated parts of working & building with AI models easier. It helps do this in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and api data, to your LLMs\n",
    "2. **Agency** - Allow your LLMs to interact with it's environment via decision making. Use LLMs to help decide which action to take next\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why LangChain?**\n",
    "1. **Components** - LangChain makes it easy to swap out abstractions and components necessary to work with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customized Chains** - LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Speed üö¢** - This team ships insanely fast. You'll be up to date with the latest LLM features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community üë•** - Wonderful discord and community support, meet ups, hackathons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: This cookbook will not cover all aspects of LangChain. It's contents have been curated to get you to building & impact as quick as possible. For more, please check out [LangChain Conceptual Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)*"
